# Chat App with React and Scaledrone
This is a GitHub repository for a web chat application created to fulfill the specifications outlined in the task. The application is implemented using React, CSS and the Redux pattern.

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. Redux makes it easy to manage the state of your application in a centralized place, making it easier to debug and understand the flow of data in your application.
For more information about Redux, please visit: https://redux.js.org/

Functional Specification:
- Create a functional user interface for chat participants
- Create new text messages
- Send messages on enter or by clicking the "send" button (display them on the screen with the author's name)
- Assign a random color and/or name to each chat participant to identify them
- Connect to the Scaledrone service and successfully simulate a conversation among all active users

Scaledrone (https://www.scaledrone.com) is a service that simplifies the implementation of chat functionality. It allows us to send data over the network in real-time and can be used for free with the following conditions: max 20 users at the same time and max 100,000 messages per day.
